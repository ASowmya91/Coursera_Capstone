Introduction/Business Problem :

I would like to build a recommender system that helps the user find a best cafe in aarhus city.
The user needs to Â´get a cafe that is nearer to his place ,has best rating ,has parking availability and a trending venue.
 
 In the lab, first step is to convert addresses into their equivalent latitude and longitude values.
 And then to use the Foursquare API to explore venues in Aarhus City.
 We use the explore function to get the most common venue categories in Aarhus and search  function to get cafes 500m near to the address.
 We then explore trending venues near the address and find rating for all cafes to find the best one near to the address.
 Finally, we will use the Folium library to visualize the cafes in Aarhus City 500 m around the address highlighting the best one.
 
Data Section :

The data required in this project is collected from foursquare location database .
I have given address of the user to foursquare database inorder get venues 500m near to the place.
I have sorted the venues in atable and then extracted cafes around that address in 500m range.

Methodology :
