Data Section:

The data required in this project is collected from foursquare location API.
The system as input takes address of the user and gives it to foursquare API in order get venues that are 500m near to the place.
The venues are sorted in a table and then cafes around that address in 500m range are extracted.
The system uses different functions like explore,search to get requireddata from Four square API.
This system used K¨Means clustering algorithm to cluster cafes around 500 m based on rating,distance and parking facilities.

Methodology :

In the lab, the first step is to convert addresses into their equivalent latitude and longitude values.
Moreover, then to use the Foursquare API to explore venues in Aarhus City.
We use the explore function to get the most common venue categories  in Aarhus and search function to get cafes 500m near to the address.
We then explore trending venues near the address and find rating for  all cafes to find the best one near to the address.
I have used k-means clustering algorithm to cluster cafes around to  three groups based on distance and rating.
Finally, we will use the Folium library to visualize the cafes in Aarhus City 500 m around the address highlighting the best one.
Coding is done in Python using IBM Watson Studio.
